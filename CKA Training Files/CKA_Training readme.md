# Introduction

This section covers all key elements of the CKA certification course from Udemy. 

It is broken down into sections as detailed in the course curriculum. 

The course follows the official Kubernetes CKA course requirements. 

- Readme docs cover my notes from the lectures, and will be updated periodically.
- Example .yml files are my attempt to answer the course quizzes
